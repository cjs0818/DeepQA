이거 좋은 아이디어네요. 아마도 구글의 Word2Vec과 딥러닝이 사용된 것이겠죠?
딥러닝으로 적어놓은 문장에서 어색한 부분을 찾아 내는 것도 충분히 가능할것 같습니다.
ICLR2016년 논문인데 session 기반의 상품추천인데 아래와 같이  수정된 RNN 을 사용했는데 기존에 비해 정확도가 20~30% 증가 한다고 합니다.
Deep Nets가 추천 시스템에서도 힘을 발휘하네요. 온라인 쇼핑몰과 유사한 사업을 하신다면 눈여겨 볼만합니다.
입력도 전체 아이템을 벡터로 (이번 세션에서 선택된 항목은 1, 나머지 0) 통채로 넣어 주네요.
모든것에 인공지능을 불어 넣겠다.
Sung Kim님께서 좋은 글이라고 추천해주셔서 공유하겠습니다.
Deep Learning의 거의 모든것이라 할수 있겠습니다! 두고두고 하나씩 볼만 합니다.
다른 도구들도 많은데 왜 TensorFlow일까요?
아래 Andrej 수업에서도 나오는 것 처럼 1. 전문 개발자 (속칭 구글러)에 의해 처음 부터 개발. (다른 도구들은 대학원생이 대부분 처음 만듬)
Multi-machine, multi-CPU, multi-GPU! 아마 multi-machine이 지원되는 유일한 도구.
우리 모두가 사랑하는 Python로 개발 가능단 하나의 단점은 Pre-trained 데이타
(transfer learning등에 사용할)가 많지 않다는 것인데 이는 사용자들이 급격하게 늘고 있으니 곧 많아 질듯합니다.
TensorFlow 의 전문가가 되어 보아요.
코드를 보면 원래 gfs에 붙어 있는 파일을 분석하도록 되어 있는거 같은데 open source로 풀면서 그쪽 코드는 전부 빠져 있더라구요 google폴더가 사라진 ㅎㅎㅎ
정말 자세하고 재미있기까지한 Neural Nets 에 대한 설명입니다.
한글 번역이 있는지 모르겠지만 없다면 번역대상 2순위라 생각합니다.
Paul Jang님께서 올려주신 글을 보고 든 생각입니다.
텐서 플로가 caffe에 비해서 사용하기는 참 편리한 데요, pretrained 모델의 성능 차이가 꽤 많이 납니다.
박사때 랩친구가 이번주에 공개한 패키지입니다.
딥러닝에서 텍스트 처리할때 (거의) 기본으로 사용하는 Word2Vec등의 모델을 Python 코드와 함께 완벽하게 알려주는 튜토리얼입니다.
TensorFlow에서 Pre-trained VGG Net을 활용하는 아주 짧은 코드입니다.
여기 계신 고수님들에겐 별 필요가 없겠지만, 저와 같이 처음 시작하는 사람들에겐 도움이 되지 않을까 해서 올립니다.
Taehoon Kim 님이 관리하시는 딥러닝 스터디 자료 + TF 구현입니다. 아주 잘 정리 되었습니다.
